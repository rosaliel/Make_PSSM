# A list of Rosetta PDB 3-letter codes for saccharide residues mapped to the
# corresponding root.

# A map is created from this data in which each key is a 3-letter code and the
# map value is the IUPAC root for that sugar.  For example, the 3-letter code
# for any glucose residue is Glc, and the corresponding root is "gluc", to
# which suffixes such as "-ose" or "-osamine" are added, as appropriate to the
# specific ResidueType.

# The data in this file serve a dual purpose:
# 1. The map is used by internal CarbohydrateInfo code for nomenclature pur-
#    poses, as noted above.
# 2. The map keys are used as a list of "Rosetta-allowed" carbohydrate 3-letter
#    codes.  Any 3-letter codes in a PDB file containing saccharide residues
#    must be converted to one of the 3-letter codes found here.  If a 3-letter
#    code is found in this list, then and only then are the HETNAM records of
#    PDB files parsed by FileData to determine specific saccharide
#    ResidueTypes.
